## Project overview

**Stage 1:** // Time estimated from the start - 1 year

-   Community based forum where anyone can ask math-related questions using a well suited interface.
-   Implementing tagging system to collect data for future needs

**Stage 2:** // Time estimated from the start - 2 year

-   Implementing a scoring and badging system to increase reliability based on collected data.
-   Expanding our math subjects to more complex interfaces such as: Geometry, graphs, etc.

**Stage 3:** // Time estimated from the start - 2.5 year

-   Data driven filtering and querying of questions & smart suggestions.

**Stage 4:** // Time estimated from the start - 4 year

-   Allowing specific users (Based on data) to create LeetCode-like math questions with pre-defined solutions.
-   Embedded math calculator with LaTex support.

**Stage 5:** // Time estimated from the start - At least 6 years

-   Embedded proof-assistant.

**Stage 6:** // Time estimated from the start - At least 8 years

-   MathmateNLP (The golden goal)

## How to contribute

### Clone & Install <a name="clone"></a>

-   Fork the repo to your github  
    `git clone https://github.com/Mathmate-il/Mathmate-client.git`
    `yarn` or `npm install` 

---

### Setup <a name="setup"></a>

### Workflow <a name="workflow"></a>

-   Connect in the discord channel to your relevant team (FE\BE\QA\UX-UI).
-   Get your first issue and open a branch for it.
-   Before any pull-request make sure your branch is up-to-date `git pull` & `git merge --squash main`

---

### Conventions <a name="conventions"></a>

-   Create functions as global as possible (Generic, reusable)
-   Readable and descriptive names to your functions and variables (Don't use "and", function is single tasked)
-   A function name must start with a verb. (create, handle, delete, update, check, etc.)
-   Variable must be a nouns, don't use acronyms! (don't: cds, uss, ion <----> do: cards, users, isOpen)
-   We already implemented pre-commit linting using husky, here is the allowed conventions,
    the syntax for your commits will be the following: `git commit -am "type: message"`
    All the allowed types:

    [ build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test ]

    **Please follow the instructions**
